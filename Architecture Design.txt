#For a backend development of an ecommerce website like Flipkart, we need to have few parent services like

category-service
notification-service
account-service
cart-service

#Under each parent service, there can be many child services.

#Here, as per the given requirement we need to focus on category-service alone

category-service:

1) list of categories
 ex: Grocery, Fashion, Electronics etc.. for each category, we will develop a new service like

grocery-service
fashion-service
electronics-service

#There can be sub categories under each category and sub-categories are nothing but a collection in MongoDB

#Here, as per the given requirement we have only two sub categories provided. mensShirts in fashion-service and laptops or mobiles in electronics service

#As per the requirement, we will be throwing an error message if any products requested apart from the available category and its sub categories.

#Consumer can get the product details in sub categories with varied filters like priceRange, availability, attributes ( if applicable ) as per the requirement
#Only Admin can add / update / delete any products at any time as per the requirement

#We need to identify each request made if it is from a consumer or admin and then act accordingly. Hence, we need to have some kind of authentication and authorization to identify a consumer or admin.
Note: For getting the products from category-service, even a guest user can be utilized ( Will implement this based on feasibility )

The Flowchart can be like

gateway-service --> category-service --> 1) grocery-service
										 2) fashion-service
										 3) electronics-service
										 
eureka-service for service discovery
zipkin-service for distributed logging mechanism
